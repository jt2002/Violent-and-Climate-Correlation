# Violent-and-Climate-Correlation

**Question:** Is violent conflict and climate change correlated?

This work tests a hypothesis based on the violent conflict data from [Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)](https://ucdp.uu.se/) of Department of Peace and Conflict Research and the data from [Climatic Research Unit](https://sites.uea.ac.uk/cru/) of University of East Anglia.

- The first worksheet extracts the violent conflict data of Kunduz, Ghazni, and Kabul and illustrates the number of people affected from 1989 to 2019 
- The second worksheet extracts their climate data (temperature and precipitation) and displays how they vary within the same period
- The third worksheet tests hypothesis and evaluates whether violent conflict and climate change is correlated
